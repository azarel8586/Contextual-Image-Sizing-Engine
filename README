# Contextual Image Sizeing Engine - CISE

CISE is a program that allows users to define a single URL for an image, but provide dynamic
resizing of content based upon the specifications of their browser / device.  The resized images
are then cached and saved for use in similar devices.  Caching occurs on a dimension basis, so
two divices with shared resolution will use the same cache image.  Also, since the cache is built
on demand, only devices that are likely to visit your site create extra file overhead.

Normal desktop
browsers will return the unadulterated image.

## Usage

Server will need the ImageMagic / Imagik extension.

Image tags will need to be formated thusly:

	<img src="/path-to-the-platter/platter.php?f=myimage.jpg" />

Other parameters can be passed in to alter the behavior of the engine (these are not required):

	?enable		Preform resizing on this image? Accepted values are either 1 or 0
	?t			{top} What is the maximum allowable size of the image - integer
	?b			{bottom} Minimum size allowed - integer
	?sc			{scale} Decimal percent larger/smaller to make the image from the determined size - ex: 0.76
	?x			X Dimension of the viewport as an override to the determined value - integer
	?y			Y Dimension of the viewport as an override to the determined value - integer
	?o			{override} context where you can supply your own useragent string to lookup against - string

## Todo

* Support the GD libraray in addition to ImageMagic / Imagik
* Refactor tests into their own entities and include dependency injection mechanisim
* Encapsulate Platter.php into its own entity to improve the user interface with the software
* Include alternate Exception types
* Include error logging
* Complete and include unit tests
* Integrate Memcache
